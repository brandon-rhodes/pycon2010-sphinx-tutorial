"""Routines for computing with circles.

The classes and functions in this package are designed to help you
compute using that most symmetric of geometric shapes, the circle.
Simple functions are provided to let you test the properties of various
circles knowing just their coordinates and radius, while a Circle class
lets you instantiate particular examples of the figure on which you can
perform more complicated operations.
