Welcome to my PyCon tutorial,
which is now in its second year at PyCon.
Sphinx has come a long way since this tutorial was first offered
back on a cold February day in 2010,
when the most recent version available was 0.6.4.
In the intervening year Sphinx reached 1.0
and, in fact, has had 11 releases in the meantime —
nearly one release per month!
I have worked to keep this tutorial up to date
with all of the most recent features in Sphinx.

This class is designed to teach you to use
the “Sphinx” documentation system,
which builds a framework around the increasingly popular
“reStructuredText” plain-text markup format
to make it easy to generate both online and offline documentation
that has searching, indexing, and cross-referencing built in.

This tutorial is organized around six small lessons,
which I am aiming to roughly divide into three phases apiece:

 1. **Explanation** (10 minutes):
    I will introduce several features of Sphinx,
    and show how they can be used and deployed in a sample project.

 2. **Exercises** (10 minutes):
    The students will then have time to sit at their keyboards
    and try out the ideas for themselves,
    practicing on a sample module that I will give them
    that is ready to have documentation written.

 3. **Discussion** (5 minutes):
    We will draw our attention back together
    and discuss what we have just learned:
    what worked, what didn't, what errors we wrestled with,
    and whether we might use these features in our own documentation.

With each lesson targeted at 25 minutes,
we should be able to fit three lessons
into each of the pair of hour-and-a-half slots
that our tutorial has been allotted here at PyCon.

Here are the six lessons,
organized as chapters of this Sphinx document:
