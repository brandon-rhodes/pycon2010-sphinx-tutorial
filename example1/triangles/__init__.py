"""Routines for computing with triangles.

The classes and functions in this package are designed to help you
compute using that most venerable of geometric shapes, the triangle.
Simple functions are provided to let you test the properties of various
triangles knowing just their dimensions, while a Triangle class lets you
instantiate particular examples of the figure on which you can perform
more complicated operations.
